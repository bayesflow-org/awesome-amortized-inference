Welcome to the Awesome Amortized Inference repository!
This is a curated list of resources, including overviews, software, papers, and other resources related to amortized inference.
Feel free to explore the entries below and use the provided BibTeX information for citation purposes.
This is a community-driven project which is currently maintained by [Marvin Schmitt](https://www.marvinschmitt.com).
Contributions are always welcome, see [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](https://github.com/bayesflow-org/awesome-amortized-inference/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) for a contribution guide.

This awesome list currently has some overlap with the `awesome-neural-sbi` list ([Link](https://github.com/smsharma/awesome-neural-sbi)) because
amortized inference has gained populatity in the context of simulation-based inference (SBI) with neural networks.
However, there is a trend towards broader amortized inference methods that are not necessarily simulation-based.
This list aims to cover all amortized inference methods, including but not limited to simulation-based inference.
We highly recommend checking out the `awesome-neural-sbi` list for more resources on modern simulation-based inference with neural networks.


> üöß **Under construction** üöß
> This repository is a development version under construction. The list of resources is just a small set for debugging and development purposes.
> For now, we focus on developing features that we think could be useful for the community (e.g., `BibTeX`-first structure).
> Then, we will evaluate whether this project has the potential to be useful for the community in addition to existing lists
> that are specifically designated to *simulation-based inference* and not *amortized inference* (which doesn't need to be simulation-based).
> Once we figure out the direction and deem the project potentially useful for the community, we'll launch and add an extensive set of resources 
> -- hopefully with the help of many awesome people from the community üß°
